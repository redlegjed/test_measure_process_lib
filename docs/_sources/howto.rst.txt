How to ...
===========

A collection or recipes for how to do various things in TMPL.


How to access measured data?
----------------------------
Measured data is stored in the *.ds_results* property of any TMPL object. Data from all measurements can be accessed from the top level *TestManager* object:

.. code-block:: python

    test_seq.ds_results

*.ds_results* is an `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_ *Dataset* object.

How to repeat a test sequence multiple times?
---------------------------------------------
Repeating a whole test sequence can be done multiple times by enabling the *Iteration* condition. This is a *SetupCondition* class that is populated by default but disabled. It is a counter where you set the number of iterations of the test sequence. To set multiple runs through the sequence follow the code below:

.. code-block:: python

    # Enable Iteration condition
    test_seq.conditions.Iteration.enable = True

    # Set iterations as a list, e.g. for 3 iterations
    test_seq.conditions.Iteration.values = [0,1,2]

    # For many iterations use a list comprehension
    test_seq.conditions.Iteration.values = [n for n in range(100)]

**WARNING** When iterating a whole sequence make sure that the code in the *Measurement* and *SetupCondition* classes can handle this, i.e. instrument settings are reset at the start of the sequence.

After the iterations have finished inspect the *test_seq.df_results* property. There will be a coordinate called *Iteration* for all measured data.

How to add a timestamp to *df_results*
---------------------------------------
This is done automatically. A *Measurement* called *Timestamp* is always added to every test sequence.
