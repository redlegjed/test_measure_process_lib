Installation
=============


TMPL depends on these libraries. 

* `xarray <http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_
* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/>`_

TMPL can be installed locally by cloning the repository to a local folder and then installing with pip

```bash
cd <local_path>
git clone https://github.com/redlegjed/test_measure_process_lib.git
pip install -e <local_path>/test_measure_process_lib

```
Note that this does not install the dependencies. This is in case another package manager, e.g. Anaconda, is being used. So they have to be manually installed.
